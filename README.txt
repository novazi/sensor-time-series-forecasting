Time-series Forecasting IDF Generator Output Sensors with LSTM Regressor

Repository created using Indonesian.

There are two models made, namely:
1. Extrapolation - Univariate - LSTM
2. Interpolation - Multivariate - LSTM

The dataset used by our group is data recorded from a wireless sensor network on an Induction Fan System obtained from the 2021 Indonesia Power Practical Work. The dataset has 17 attributes.
